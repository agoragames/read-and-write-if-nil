This is a duck punch for ActiveSupport::Cache::Store which allows you to read 
from the cache and immediately write to it if the cache entry is nil. For example:

ids = Rails.cache.read_and_write_if_nil("member_ids_for_clan_#{@clan.id}", 
                                          :expires_in => 5.minutes) do
  @clan.members.find(:all, :order => 'groupies DESC', :select => 'accounts.id').collect(&:id)
end

To use, put read_and_write_if_nil.rb in your lib and require from environment.rb
